# P2-Simulator

The following parameters are drawn from a document, from which specific context is omitted: 

Purpose: replace convential pavement with a permeable pavement alternative

Key parameters: surface water runoff, erosion, CO2 budget of materials and construction, total budget, infiltration and storage, load bearing capacity, surface traction and smoothness

Constraints related to material selection, dimensioning, and testing conditions, are as follows: 0.5m by 0.5m wooden frame, lined with a geotextile, padded with a 0.03m layer of sand. A small cutout will permit the flow of surface water runoff, and infiltration tests will be performed at a 5Ëš slope. The materials available for use are provided in a "materials" .xls file, along with quotes on a per unit scale.
